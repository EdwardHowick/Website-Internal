                            <p>Mountain bikes are robust, versatile bicycles specifically designed to handle rough terrain and off-road cycling. Featuring a sturdy frame, wide tires with deep treads for superior grip, and a suspension system to absorb shocks from uneven surfaces, these bikes are built for durability and performance. The frames are typically made of materials like aluminum, carbon fiber, or steel to ensure strength and longevity. Mountain bikes come equipped with either front suspension (hardtail) or both front and rear suspension (full suspension) to smooth out bumps and increase control. Their wide, knobby tires provide excellent traction on dirt, mud, rocks, and loose surfaces, while powerful disc brakes offer reliable stopping power in all conditions. Additionally, mountain bikes are designed with a wide range of gears to help riders tackle steep climbs and descents effectively.</p>

                            <p>Road bikes are sleek, lightweight bicycles engineered for speed, efficiency, and performance on paved surfaces. These bikes feature a streamlined design, narrow tires, and a lightweight frame to minimize resistance and maximize speed. Road bike frames are typically made from materials like aluminum, carbon fiber, or titanium, offering a balance of strength and lightness. The drop handlebars allow for multiple hand positions, improving aerodynamics and comfort during long rides. The thin, high-pressure tires reduce rolling resistance, enabling faster speeds with less effort. Road bikes are equipped with a precise gear system to provide smooth shifting and optimize performance on varied terrains and inclines.</p>

                            <p>Electric bikes, also known as e-bikes, seamlessly integrate traditional cycling with battery-powered assistance, revolutionizing the way people ride. These bicycles are equipped with an electric motor, either integrated into the frame or attached to the wheel hub, providing varying levels of support based on rider input and settings. Electric bikes come in various styles, including road bikes, mountain bikes, and commuter bikes, catering to different riding preferences and terrain types. The primary purpose of electric bikes is to enhance the cycling experience by offering additional power when needed, making riding easier and more accessible to a broader range of individuals.</p>
