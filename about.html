                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Our story began with a simple love for cycling. Joe The Goat, our founder, started this store with a vision to create a community hub where cyclists could find not only the best bikes but also a place to connect, share experiences, and get expert advice.<br> Over the years, our dedication to customer satisfaction and our deep knowledge of the industry have helped us grow into the trusted bike store we are today.</p>
                <p>As we look to the future, our goal remains the same: to be the go-to destination for cyclists in our area. We are constantly seeking new ways to enhance our offerings and better serve our customers. Whether you're buying your first bike, upgrading to a high-performance model, or just looking for some friendly advice, we're here to help.</p>
